// Revenue splits are schemes that define how the ticket revenue will be split internally. In a
// revenue split scheme a split for each revenue split category is defined. The split can either
// be a fixed amount or a percentage amount on the ticket price.
//
// By linking a revenue split to an event, you define how the ticket revenue will be split for
// that event. The same revenue split can be linked to multiple events.
